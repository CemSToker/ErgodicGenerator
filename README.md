# ErgodicGenerator
Turbo-charged ergodic trajectory optimizer for 2D workspaces using CMA-ES, vectorized Fourier/DCT ergodicity metrics, and parallel evaluation. Generates smooth B-spline paths inside an elliptical workspace, balances coverage with motion smoothness via robot penalties, uniform or custom targets, and fast multi-core execution.
